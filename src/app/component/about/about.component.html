        <h2>A Bit About Myself</h2>
        Hello, I'm Punith Kumar â€” a software engineer and aspiring artist, wandering through life with a bit of
        overthinking, a lot of daydreaming, and a deep sense of awe and inspiration from the incredible art and
        craftsmanship of others, both in engineering and arts.
        <br><br>
        Well that's about it from me --
        Cheers!!!
